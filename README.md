# Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Assessment Project

In this repo, you will find information on how to use run_analysis.R code.

* First download and unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder to "dataset".

* The folder "dataset" and run_analysis.R code should be placed in the current working directory.

* After running run_analysis.R command in RStudio, two output files will be generated in the current working directory: "merged_data.txt" and "mean_tidy", where the later has computed means of all measures, grouped by subject_id and by activity.
